bless in perl:
--------------
bless causes the reference contained in its first parameter to become an object of the class specified in the second argument. The reference is essentially "blessed into a class.", or possibly more descriptively, "promoted", or "reborn" into a class.

Before being blessed, a reference is just a reference. After being blessed, it's an object instance of a particular class.
